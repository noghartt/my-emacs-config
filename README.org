#+title: A (not yet named) Emacs config

This is a simple Emacs configuration that is being created to learn more about
Emacs and Emacs Lisp, and get an useful configuration to my workflow. That initially
consists in:

- Emacs as a Code Editor (for Web and other weird things);
- Org-mode as my "noter workflow", with =org-roam= and other stuffs.
